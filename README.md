# Week-4-Game-Rpg

##Objective
The goal of this game is to practice using Jquery and Javascript to rotate through a set of enemies and have to defeat them.

##How it works
The user selects the character they want to be then they choose an opponent to attack, if they defeat that opponent they move on to the next until they are out of opponents or defeated.

*Each attack will increment the user's character's attack points up by one unit of their original value. (i.e. if Cartman's attack power is 10hp, each attack it will go up 11hp).
*Each character has a "counter attack" value, these are independent to the attack value and do not change over the course of the game
